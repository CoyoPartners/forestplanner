      <h1>About the Forest Planner</h1>
      <p>
        Ecotrust has created the Forest Planner to give forest management scenario planning capacity to all Oregon and Washington land managers. Users will be able to <em>visualize alternative management scenarios</em> on your lands and receive immediate feedback on <em>how decisions might pay off</em> in terms of timber harvests and financial returns, as well as <em>public benefits</em> like carbon storage and ecosystem services.
      </p>

      <hr>

      <h3>With the Forest Planner, you will be able to:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Find and map your property with helpful map layers such as tax lots.</li>
        <li>Map out the forest stands and management units on your property with helpful map layers such as riparian buffers and steep slopes.</li>
        <li>Define and map out the type of trees found in each of your stands (species, diameter class, trees per acre).</li>
        <li>Choose from a spectrum of harvest practices and apply them to the management units you want.</li>
        <li>Create customized management scenarios that represent the combination of management practices you assigned across your property.</li>
        <li>Quickly compare different management scenarios with graphs and maps; see outputs like timber yields and stocking, carbon storage, and more.</li>
        <li>Securely and confidently store and manage data about your property and management scenarios you have run.</li>
	  </ul>

Any dispute between the parties will be governed by this Agreement and the laws of the State of Oregon and applicable United States law, without giving effect to any conflict of laws principles that may provide for the application of the law of another jurisdiction.
